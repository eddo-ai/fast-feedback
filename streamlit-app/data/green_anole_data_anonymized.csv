But the green lizards never really went too far up, and therefore didn't need to worry about having extra grip or toe pad area for the thin branches.

The green lizards also tend to perch on even higher tree branches when the brown lizards got introduced to the island. The body structure of the green lizard has toe pads and sticky scales that help them climb higher. When comparing the green lizards that live on the island with brown lizards to the green lizards that don't live with brown lizards, the research shows that the green lizards that live with brown lizards have a higher amount of things that help them climb higher. For example the green lizards that live with brown lizards perch at an average of 120 cm, have an average size of toe pads of 1.33 cm, and have 54 sticky scales on their feet. This is a big difference compared to the green lizards that don't live with brown lizards because they perch at an average height of 75 cm, an average size of toe pads of 1.27, and only have 51 sticky scales on their feet. Even though the difference might seem small, they are significant for an animal of their size.","The perching height of green lizards changed overtime as more brown lizards got introduced to the island. For example in the year 1995 the population before the change had an average perching height of around 80 cm. There was an environmental change when brown lizards got introduced to certain islands. This change caused the green lizards that now lived with the brown lizards to perch higher and higher over the course of a couple years. For example, in 1996 the average height of perching skyrocketed to 108 cm which was a growth of almost 30 cm in 1 year. In 1997 the average height was 110, and in 1998 the average height was 120 cm. This evidence shows that the green lizards that live with the brown lizards tend to perch higher and use different food sources. Another example is the different kinds of plants that the lizards eat. There are some plants that are higher off the ground and that are thinner and smoother compared to the ones on the ground. This can explain why the green lizards started to perch higher when the brown lizards came. Brown lizards tend to stay lower to the ground so they eat the plants on the branches that grow lower to the ground. If the green lizards were also eating the same plants there would be a competition to survive because there are limited food options. This competition then would have caused the green lizards to look for food somewhere else. There was food higher up so  over the years they developed the traits that helped them reach higher branches and heights. This also makes sense to why the brown lizards now populate the islands where there was originally only green lizards because the brown lizards were able to eat, survive, and reproduce.

- **Strength:** The student attempts to explain what might have caused the population decline (e.g., ""**it was the animals around them and thereselfs that cased them to die**"").
- **Area for Improvement:** The explanation lacks scientific accuracy and does not address natural selection, trait variation, or environmental change leading to advantages or disadvantages. It also includes misconceptions (e.g., ""**many things wrong with it**"" suggests a misunderstanding of traits and adaptation).

---",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"- You show enthusiasm and concern for the survival of the green lizards, which is an important starting point for exploring scientific explanations.

4/28/2025 8:50:30,Hour 3,"I noticed that green lizards who live on islands with brown lizards tend to have a higher perch height (about 110-120 cm) in the trees they hang in. While, green lizards who live on islands with no brown lizards tend to have a lower perch height (about 75-85 cm) in the trees they hang in. I also noticed that the green lizards who live on an island with brown lizards have larger toe pads and more sticky scales on their feet, most likely because they climb higher into the trees. While, the green lizards who live on an island with no brown lizards tend to have smaller toe pads and less sticky scales on their feet, most likely because they don't climb as high. ","Natural selection affected the green lizard population over time. 

The change that we noticed in the population was that as brown lizards came to the islands, the perch height of the green lizards became higher. But, before the brown lizards came to the island, the perch height of the green lizards was lower. For example, the average perch height for the population before the change (green lizards on islands without brown lizards) was 75 centimeters into the trees. While, the average perch height for the population after the change (green lizards on islands with brown lizards) was 120 centimeters into the trees. 

But, what could've caused this change is certain environmental interactions. For example, green lizards on islands with brown lizards have larger toe pads (1.33 cm) and more sticky scales on their feet (54), most likely to have a better grip on the trees they climb. The trees these lizards rest in usually have thinner and smoother branches that are high above the ground, which can make it difficult for them to hang on to. Therefore, it makes sense that green lizards have certain features on their feet that help them adjust to heights far above the ground (advantageous traits) and help them reach higher perch heights. While, green lizards on islands without brown lizards have smaller toe pads (1.27 cm) and less sticky scales on their feet (51) which would've made it a lot harder for them to climb high because they have a weaker grip (unfavorable traits). Since they have a weaker grip, they have lower perch heights.  

This could've affected the survival and reproduction of green lizards on islands without brown lizards because those unfavorable traits (smaller toe pads and less sticky scales) could've made it harder for them to live in their habitat and climb higher into the trees. 
Therefore, if they couldn't survive and reproduce because of these unfavorable traits, they couldn't have offspring and there would be unfavorable traits inherited if they did reproduce. They would most likely reproduce offspring that had small toe pads and less sticky scales making it harder for them to adjust and climb higher in their habitat. 

But, we notice that the population after the change (green lizards on islands with brown lizards) had a higher perch height and more favorable traits (toe pads and more sticky scales). This could've been caused by the possibility that brown lizards don't climb as high into the trees, influencing the green lizards to climb higher into the trees so that there could be a balance in the habitat. The introduction of brown lizards to the island forced green lizards to over time adapt and develop favorable traits, compared to the unfavorable traits that they originally had before the brown lizards were introduced. By green lizards developing these favorable traits, they were able to survive and reproduce. And then they would be able to have offspring that inherit these favorable traits, improving the population. In conclusion, the process of natural selection not only introduces new organisms, but influences other organisms to develop certain adaptations that help them survive and reproduce to create offspring and inheritance.

The number of sticky scales on the feet are also different. Green lizards on an island with no brown lizards have an average of about 51 scales, while the ones who live with the brown lizards have 54 scales. This shows that there is a difference if they live with or without the brown lizards. And if they live with the brown lizards, their body structures seem to increase like the sticky scales or size of the toe pads.","Before brown lizards started to occupy the islands that only the green lizards lived in, like in Florida, green lizards tend to only perch 75 cm in trees. And green lizards tend to hang out higher in trees than the brown lizards. But after the brown lizards started to occupy the green lizard's lands, statistics show that green lizards started to perch even higher in trees. Because in 1995, they perched about 75 cm but as the years moved forward, in 1998, they increased and were perching at 120 cm in trees. This shows that the brown lizards moving to their islands made a huge impact on how much they were perching. Since the brown lizards were climbing on the green lizard's trees, this leaves the green lizards with no place to climb to, to hide, run away from predators, and to reproduce. So the only solution the green lizards could come up with was to climb even higher than the brown lizards. Over time, this causes the green lizards on an island with brown lizards to start making changes with their body structure. So when they continue to reproduce, their off springs start to adapt with climbing higher trees. So after a while, their average size of toe pads changed from 1.27 cm to 1.33  cm after they started living with the brown lizards. Same with the sticky scales on the feet, it started with 51 scales but increased to 54 scales over time. Both the size of the toe pad and the number of sticky scales can help the green lizards climb higher and the trees that have branches farther off the ground are thinner and smoother compared to the branches closer to the ground which also makes it harder for the green lizards to perch higher. So if their toe pad size increases and the sticky scales also increase, it will help their performance with perching higher so that they could find space to hang out on. This is a natural selection because the green lizard's population is slowly adapted to climbing even higher in trees.

Compared to the green lizards that don't live with the brown lizards, they tend to stay the same height because they have their territory to themselves and their privacy. Since the green lizards that live with the brown lizards started going up so high, this most likely helped them develop their toe pads due to how difficult it is to stay on the high branches.

On the islands with only green lizards, the perch height in the trees has stayed around the same height, and their toe pads are smaller and they have fewer sticky scales than the other green lizards on the islands with both species. ","Population Before the Change:
Before the arrival of the brown lizards on certain islands, the Green Anole lizards would perch in trees at a height of around 75 cm. On their bodies, the size of their toe pads was 1.27 cm, and the amount of sticky scales that they had on their bodies was 51 scales. 
Environment: 
The change in the environment is the arrival of the Brown Anole lizard. 
Survival and Reproduction:
After the brown lizards came to certain islands with green lizards, the green lizards had to adapt to the new changes that the brown lizards brought. They began to perch up on higher branches. The average perch height went from 75 cm to 120 cm after the brown lizards came. They also had to change their bodies, because the higher tree branches were smoother and thinner than the branches closer to the ground, which meant they were harder to hold on to. The size of their toe pads went from 1.27 cm to 1.33 cm, and the amount of sticky scales on their bodies changed from 51 scales to 54 scales. The differences are small but are also significant for these lizards because the adaptations are what helps them survive after the brown lizards came to the islands they lived on. 
Offspring and Inheritance: 
Over the years, we see the perch height of the green lizards increase on the islands with both types of lizards. The size of their toe pads has also increased, as well as the amount of sticky scales they have. This happened because after the brown lizards arrived, the green lizards began to change so they could survive the brown lizards. The traits that helped the green lizards are favorable traits because it helps the green lizards stay alive. This means that those favorable traits will be passed on to the offspring of the green lizards and will increase the amount of lizards with those surviving traits.

After the arrival of the Brown Anole lizard, the green lizards learned that they could not survive with the same traits they had before the brown lizard came. Just months after the brown lizards were introduced to the islands, the green lizards moved into higher branches. Climbing up to higher branches is what caused the change of their toe pads and sticky scales, since changing these traits helped them climb higher into trees where the branches were skinnier and smoother and therefore harder to stay on. This means that over time, there were more lizards with these specific, favorable traits because the green lizards that reproduced chose to reproduce with mates that had traits that helped them climb into higher branches.
